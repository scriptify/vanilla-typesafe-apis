# Type-safe APIs using vanilla TypeScript

_This is not a library or framework. It is rather a simple solution to implement fullstack typesafe APIs without external dependencies._

You can have the cake and eat it too.

End-to-end type-safe APIs without dependencies or ecosystem buy-in. Just your REST APIs, some TypeScript, and a happy developer.

We only want effortless, type-safe APIs all the way down the stack. This is how it should work:

And that indeed is how it works!

The concept is very simple: TypeScript API controllers that expose all needed typing information and runtime type safety thanks to standard JSON Schemas.

## Key Features

- **Type-Safe REST APIs:** Leverage TypeScript for both compile-time and runtime type safety without additional libraries.
- **Zero Dependencies:** Implement type safety using native TypeScript features and JSON Schemas.
- **Seamless Developer Experience:** Enjoy the benefits of type-safe APIs without the overhead of adopting a new framework or library.
